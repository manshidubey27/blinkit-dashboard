Headline: 📊 Decoding Quick Commerce: A Deep Dive into Blinkit's Sales Performance

Post Body:

🚀 I’m excited to share my latest project! I recently developed a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard analyzing grocery sales data for Blinkit, India's leading last-minute delivery app.

This project focuses on visualizing key metrics to understand outlet performance, item popularity, and customer preferences across different tiers.

💡 Key Insights & Features:

Overview: Tracked Total Sales ($248.99K), Average Ratings (3.9), and Total Items Sold (1,753).

Outlet Analysis: Segmented data by Outlet Size (High/Medium/Small) and Location (Tier 1, 2, & 3 cities).

Product Breakdown: Analyzed sales by 'Item Type' (Snack Foods, Fruits, Frozen Foods) and 'Fat Content' (Regular vs. Low Fat).

Trend Analysis: Visualized the growth of outlet establishments from 2012 to 2020.

Interactive Filters: Incorporated slicers for Outlet Location, Size, and Item Type to allow dynamic data exploration.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Microsoft Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)

Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)

DAX (Calculated Measures & Custom Logic)

Data Modelling

This dashboard provides a clear snapshot of how different outlet types (Grocery Stores vs. Supermarkets) contribute to overall revenue and how customer ratings vary across categories.

I'd love to hear your feedback or thoughts on the visualization! 👇
